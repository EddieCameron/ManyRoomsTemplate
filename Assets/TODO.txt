x add the depth sorting / multicamera stuff
- build some problematic rooms (see if the camera can handle this)
	x basic problem: only rooms with exits on the N + W (or 90deg) walls. Causes rooms to loop back into themselves
	- u turn
	- concave connection
	- door not axis aligned
	- multiple doors on the same wall
- build an exporter script
	- runs validation on the submitted room
	- builds unitypackage
	- uploads? probably too much.
- write tutorials for how to build and export
	- blender
	- sketchup
- fun thing: auto walkthrough? build a path that lerps through the different rooms
- make a readme file for this project

x only collide with current room
x build some door prefabs
